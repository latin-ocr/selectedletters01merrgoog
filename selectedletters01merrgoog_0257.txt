Pliny's, occurring filtcen times in the letters.

Claudius not only was himself an author, hut gave readings
from his werke bsiere assuming the principata, and aiter that
time employed one ei hia slaves to aet ior him viceriously in
the sarno matter, as indeed Pliny at ene time thought ef dein
(ci. tx. 34. l). Pliny might heve found u nobler example ei
an imperial auditor in Augustus (ei. Suet. Aue. 89 recitantis
et beatique et petierucr audiit, aee mulum carmine et historica,
ved et erutione-r ei dialogo„ Suet. Tit. 61 ; and en the recita·

Palatio: Claudius lived in the &mue ditmare on the
west side oi the Palatioe; bnt Palatio must not be talen here

imperial residenee on the Palatine is always άοηιιω Palatina,
Argentaria, Tiberiane. On the north-eastern part el the hill
Augustus had built e temple ef Apelle, with Latin and Greek
libraries, and perticees adyeining (Suet. Aug. 29), end this was
