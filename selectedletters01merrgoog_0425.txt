Clitumnum funum: Vibius sequester, of the fourth ⁵

century, in his dry enumeration entitled De fluminibus l
soricibus lacubus rumoribus pulrtdibus meruitne yeruihua,
mentions the Clitumnus as a spring as well as a river, but
perhaps with no ultimate authority other than this passage.
he river (now called the Clitunno) isa small stream of
Umbria, flowing by Meuania (Bevagna) into the Tinia
(Topinch au affluent of the Tiber. The hsmlet at its source
is even now called Le Vene (ie. 'Phe Spriugs). The river was
. famous for its beauty before Pliny's time, and especially for
the herda of large white cattle pastured on itabens, whence
the flncst sacrificial victims were sent to Rome: cf. Colum

’ὑ Han. 506 ffi-Seruius (on Verg. Geor. tc.) remarks, on the
authority of Pliny's Nat. Hist, that animala drinking the
water cf the Clitumnus bring forth white progeny3 but
the same story is told of other streames-eg. oft ose of the
region of Falerii; cf. Plin. ΜΗ. 11. 230 io Falisco omnis aquo
poto carulidos bmmsacit (this is perhaps the passage to which
Servius refers). Addison in his Renrorka on Italy notes that
in his day the inhabitants of Le Vene had the same belief
about the waters, and pointed to their meuse-coloured herds
us evidence of its truth. Byron celebrated the stream in
