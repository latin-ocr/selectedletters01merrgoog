30. 2. NOTES. 297

illlum amisit: whether as the result of the perjurias
mentioned in 11. 20. 6 (Sel. 22) is nowhere stated. According
to the probable date oi composition of Mart. vr. suu-1110
celebrates the infant precocity of the child as shown in a
liking lor court-scenes, he must have been born in an. 87
or 88, and therefore, lrorn the possible date ol this book of
the letters (ei. Introd. pp. xxxvii ff.) his death occurred not
far from the time when he would have taken the topa uirilis.

tresdo an: perhaps with an inclination toward the
negative; cf. 1. 15. 3 (Sel. 10) n. rusae aa.

2. emanciparit: the son could not legally hold propert
unless set free from the absolute patria potestas into which
every child ol a Roman citizen was born, if born in legal
wedloclr. And se long as the father lived, and both father
and son retained their ri rhts as citizens, the patria potestas
could be terminated onlyby the voluntary act of the father,
thrice repeated, in selling his son to a third party, who aiter
each successive sale set him free, as he might a duly pur-
chased slave: cl. Gaius 1. 132; Ulp. freq. x. l. 'l'he
theoretical ri ht ol a father to sell his children at plcasure
was thus ma e use of, by legal fiction, ιο secure their legal
independenee.

ut heres matris exsisteret: the wife oi Regulus was (as
was usual in marriages at this period) evidently not married
ιο him in any one ci the ways that brought her in martum
auriti, and so had not forfeited her right to hold property.
And she had desircd ιο leave her property directly to her sen,
who could be qualitied ιο hold it in his own right only by
being dnly ernancipatcd froin the μανία potatas, ιο which act
Regulus assented; cl. a similar case in v111. 18. 4 Curtilius
Materia, peronia perrarum mirina . . . aab ea amalicione filiam
ciras, neptem suant, instituerat heredem, si sanctarena patria
amiam. Pliny ap rently wishes to eonvey the intimatiou
that the mother istrnsted the father's good faith by her
action, an inferenee that is not warranted by the facts
presented, and is accordingly unjust ιο Regulus.

mancipatura: with a play on the meaning oi the word,
which is occisionally used technieally of dceding oror to
another (like amamipartl, lnrt also meant ‘to eapturc ' (anaim
caywrcl instead oi ‘to r‹·h·ase.' 'l'he intimation is thut thc
-act of Regulus in lrecing his son was ‹ndy a shrewd dodgc to
cernent minc fully his inlhmnrc rna-r the lad, now become,
actually or prospcrnrcly, rich in his· own right.

ex moribus homnis: ar. as a fortune-liariter.
