xxiv O. PLINI EPISTVLAE eumerus.

immediately after his praetorehip the emperor shewed
him further confidence and favour by making him one
of the three prefects of the military treasury.¹ If three
years lateran accusation against him by the infamous
informer, Mettius Carus, was found in the arohives of
Domitian after that emperor’s death,² its presence
proves only that (larus would have liked to involve
Pliny in the fate of his friend Senecio. There is no
certainty that the accusation was oi late date, or that
the emperor had not simply deelined to aet upon it,
aud accordingly filed it away. It is true that Pliny
in later years, and in a distinetly ‘apeme statement³
suggests that Domitian would hare promoted him to
tho consulship (to which indeed he would hare been
eligible without special grace only in 96), had he
himself been a more obsequious courtier. But a
prefect of the military treaeury commonly served
three years, and quite probably then only could
usually expect promotion to the consulship. And
Pliny’s term as prefect certainly could not have
expired before 96, the year of Domitian’s death. It
is much to be feared that after Domitian's death
Pliny tried to make out the best case possible for
himself, whereas during Domitian’s reign he iras
entirely persone prule with the emperor, and his
discretiori held his sympathies in proper eberh.
