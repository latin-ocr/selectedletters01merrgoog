reliquos pontifices: the emperor regularly suceeeded to
the title, rights, and duties of the pmitij‘ex munimen of repub·
lican times. As head of the state religion his jurisdiction
over the Vestul Virgins was that oi the patina potestas, which
was absolute, even to tlie inilictiou of a death sentence. But
as the paterfamilias wus not supposed to aet as a jiidge in
such serious matters without calling into consultation u
consiliam of near relatives, or of neighbours‚ so apparently
the permisere maximin was not expected to act without coii-
sulting the whole college ol pontiffs. On the cornilione of a
iiiagistiate el. i. 9. 2(8εΙ, 6) n. in cavaedium.

Regiam: originally the royal palaea, if the tradition of
name caii be trusted, and then the office. il not the actual
residenee, oi the pontifex nausimus, as tlie ahiel religious
successor of tlie king. The biiililiiig stood on the Sacra Via
to the east of tlie temple ol Julius Caesar, and its ruins liare
recently been thorouglily excavated ior the first time by Sig.

Albanam villam: the ,so-called Arx Albana, an immense
and strongly walled area, develo ed by Domitian out of a
simpler country-estate of the earlier emperors, and includ-
ing within it not only a magnificent imperial residence‚ biit
batha, temple, theatra, amphitheatra, aud quartem lor a

patria potestas an ywhere, and Domitian was lond of summon-
ing councils to his Albanum (cl. the famous ease oi tlic tiirliot

in qu. 4).

absentem inauditamque: Pliny disregards the fact that
this was not a trial, but the mere passing of sentence, at
which tlie presence ol the defendant was not required even
under the forins oi the ordinary procedure, ep. ol the Roman
senate. And Suetonius says (Dum. 8), Pei-aeliani, maximam
uirginem, aliaolutani olim, dein longo interuallo repetitam uiqiie
collaticium ‹letodi insperserit, implying no iilen of iiijiisticc in
the matter, though he is by no means a partisan of Domitian.
New evidence hau very proliabl been discovered; iiiiil iii a
case ol family discipl ine, as this tlieoretically w'ns. no principle

nined.

allectiva, luit Pliny must have recogiiimd its laeli ol force
