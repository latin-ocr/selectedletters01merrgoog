³94 C. PLINI EPISTVLAE SELEOTAE. 66. 1.

66. (11 ιι.)

Α nequest ior a lreedman's pardon. (Th'e companiou letter
is lx. 24,—Se'l. lidi-Sabinianus is otherwise unknown-This
letter is sometimes compared with that ol st. Paul to
Philemon. But where Pliny puts the plea for ardon ou
practical, humanitatism and philosophie grounds (‘he is

sorry; he won’t do so agaim and you injure yourseli hy '

pnlper ’ll' St. Paul puts it upon the ground ol Christian
e ows rp.

1. libertus: rso-called, instead of libertinam, since here he is
spoken ol in his immediate relation to his iormer owner.

mihssuomm mdlbus: ci. 1. 18. 3 (Sel. 121 n. aduoluta
n . .

’ tusumma: ol. 1. 12. 12 (Sel. 8) ιι. ia samma.

8. ne torseris illum: the freedmau was still, iu the eye oi
the law, a member oi the familia, and therefore, like children
aud slaves, was subiect to punishment at the will ol the
puter familior lor wrong doing: hlothing is known in detail

though it mav be doubted whether their condition in this
respect was much better than that oi slaves, who were

ractieally undeiended imm most savage treatment at the
hands ol their masters, except that death, and such other
tillut‘l{intinniitaltitudinum?lidi
(ci. Diy. xv111. 1.42; xnvur. 8. 11. 2; et al). But liuy so
frequently uses this verb (and its corresponding noun) to
denote purely mental disquietude or suffering that it may be
doubted whether he does not so use it here, oi the freedmsn
as well as ol the master: cf. ιἰ. 1. 2; 7. 3 (Sel. 43); vn. 5.
2(Sel. 481; 12. 4ς 19. 9 (Sel. 50);30.1;v111.23.9. And
the first sentence oi rx. 24 (Sel. 68) indicates that the punish·
ment leared was not plrysical, but at the most consisted in
banislrment from the sensilia, and perhaps from the city (see
note thereupon).

no torseris etiam te. toreumatum: on the epanalepsis
see ι l. 1 (Sel. 11ιι. colliperem. . . collem ιν. 13. 1
(Sel. 33) n. uenisse.

⁴. lterum rogabo. impetrabo lterum: with the chiastic
repetition cf. 1. 12. 12 (Sel. 8) n. morte doleo.
