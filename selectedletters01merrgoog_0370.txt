34. (1V· 19.)

The good qualities of Pliny’s wife-Calpurnia Hispulla,
to whom this letter is arldressecl, was the daughter of
Calpurnius Fabatus (cf. ἓ l n. aare), and paternal aunt of
Pliny's wife, Calpurnia. She had taken the place oi an early
lost mother to her brother's daughter, who was apparently
the only grandchild of the family (v111. 10. 2). References
to her are numerous in the letters, and Pliny adelrcsses to
her directly one other epistle, in which he speaks of his wife’s
prospectire recovery from a sudden and critical illness (vni
ll). Hispulla apparently remained the typical mairlen aunt
throughout her life, living with hcr father at Connnn, and
survivlng him (x. 120, lai-Sel. 108, 109), as well aS,
probably, Pliny himself.

On Pliny’s marriages see x. 2. ‘2 (Sel. 74) n. (lrwhwa inuh-i-
moniia On his warin attachment to Calpurnia cf. his letters
to her, v1. 4, 7; v11. 5 (Sel. 4⁶2, 43, 48). This letter was
apparently written not many months after the marriage.

patris amissi: he had been (lead for some time when v.
ll was written (of. note ou aaa below), but whether hc died
before Pliny's marriage to his daughter· is entirely uncertain.
It is strange that Pliny refers here only to Cal uruia's father,

and not to her mother, whose place in the e ucation ol the
orphan Hispulla had taken.

adfectum: entirely post-classical iu the sense of ‘allec
tion' as a synonym for lore.

Livy aud later writers. Pl. uses reon drab. only once with
