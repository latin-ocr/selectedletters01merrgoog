one oi the first book to which a date can be assigned within a
small limit oi time. lt was written within only a few
months aiter the murder oi Domitian, but later than Jan. l,
97. The emperor is dead (ἓ 1), the new annual magistrates
have entered upon office (311), but lunius Mauricus, oue oi the
politieal exiles ol Domitian’s reign, though robably already
recalled by Nerva, has not yet arrived in ome (ἓ) 10, 15,

reputation aa a voluntary informer in the last years oi Nero's
reign (see 111. 7. a-sel. 25,-n. sperate accitanam), and upon
the accession oi Vespasian was rescued from veugeance only
by the efforts oi his younger and better brother, Vipstanus
Messalla (see Tac. Hs'st. iv. 42). There seems to be no
evidence that hc prosecuted the trade oi informer under
Domitian, in spite oi Pliny’s virulenoe against him in this
letter, which seems ιο have been aroused chiefly by the post
mortem attach made by Regulus, as a firm sup rter oi
Domitian, u n Pliny's revered friends, Rusticus an Senecio.
Whatever uricus may hare advised on his return (510),-
and it was probably prosecution,—Nerva aiter the first was
uniavonrable to a revival oi old leuds by a new batch of pro·
