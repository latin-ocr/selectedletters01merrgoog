Like some other writers ol his dey Pliny likes tc try nis
haud at pieees oi description. This letter und its compenion
piece, u. 6, a description oi his country-seat on a loothill oi
the Umbrian Apennines (near Cittt di Castello), are his
most ambitione attempta iu this direction, and cannot be
called very successful. Neither the theme nor the catalogue
mcthod oi treatment arouses in the render the enthusiastn
that the writer aims to produce. But the present letterls
