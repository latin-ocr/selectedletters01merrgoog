efforts of emperor and governor were now especially directed ;
but the apparently innocuous character of the organization,
and perhaps also the willingness of confession, and the in·
comprehensible fortitude and joy with which—to judge from
the reporta of other persecutione-the condemned probably
wentto their death, made a man of Pliny’s good sense and
kindliness of feeling halt in the plain and simple interpreta-
tion and execution of the law, and appeal to the emperor for

specific instructions—There is no reason to suppose that ·

nomen bas any reference to the Sacred Name, the bearing of
which is alleged by later Christian apologista (ay. Tertull.
Apol. 2) to be in itself declared a crime by the Roman law.
At a later date the Christisns were indeed punished for their
lack of confomrity to the established state-religion, but it
cannot be clearly shown, in spite of attem ts in thatdirection,
that such was the principle of Roman ministration at this
