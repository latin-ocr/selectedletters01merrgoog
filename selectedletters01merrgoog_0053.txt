Pms'r's world-partly because it is presented with such
rich detail-reminds us, more then that of any other period

eighteenth tn the nineteent-lr century. In other respects.
indeed, they have what might be called an eighteentlr century
flavour. Some oi the more elaborate ol thern would inll quite

naturally inte plaee among the essays ol the Spectator or the
Rambler3 in many others the combination oi thin and lucid

common-sense with a vein oi ealculeted sensibility can hardly

be paralleled till we reach the age ol Romaene-J. W.
