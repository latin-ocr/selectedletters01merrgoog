Announcin Pliny’s arrival at Ephesus on his way 1ο
Bithynia-Pliny arrived in Ephesus in the hot reason, and in
Bithynia on Sept. 17 (sec x. l'is. 2.-Se1. 83). He remained
thcre at least till aiter the next winter hutone following his
arrival, ior the usual uota upon the anniversary oi the
emperor’s birth, oi the new year, and oi his accession, are
mentioned twice in due order and succession (lim-Sel. 83.-
and 88‚-Sel. 102; 35,-se1. 90‚-and 100; 52‚-Se1. 04,-
and 102), and the chronological series oi letters continues ior
some time aiter the last letter oi this class. His appointrnent,
therefore, had extended over about two years at the time
when the correspondence cesses. The inscription in which
Pliny’s curatae horrorum appears (aee Introd. p. xl.) gives the
titles oi the emperor without that ol optimu which be
acce ted in 114. Pliny's governorship therefore terminated
(prohably by his death-see Introd. . xxviii.)ssesrlyas 113.
'l'he beginning oi his term munet, therefore, have been later
than 111 (aad ior other reasons also than that iiied). It
could hardly haue been earlier than 108, or pro hly 109,-
ii, indeed, as seems certain, ali the letters oi 1.·1x. were
written beiore the appointment; ior vm. 23 must hare been
written not beiore 108. Another indication is giren by the
ieet that Calpurnius Macer was im rial legate in Moesia
Inferior in the first calendar years ter Pliny's ap intinent
(x. 42, 61. 62, 77), and an inscription shows him tc are been
governor there in the year 1120111. 111. 71). But hiscer
