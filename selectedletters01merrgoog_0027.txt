INTRODUGI'ION. ¹¹iii

Between the tribunata aud the praerorship Pliny

did not have to wait the usual year, for the emperor's
special grace relievcd him of that otherwise legal
necessity.l He therefore became praetor almost
immediately r'on Jarruary l, 93) rrpon laying down
the tribunatc, and continued therein for that year
which marked Domitian’s attempt to crush the Staio
opposition, the imitation, and as the emperor thought
the danger, of which had then reached ite culmination,
Among Pliny's wamr personal friends were marry of
the prominent men of that ‘opposition’ ththcr hc
tried to do, or could have done, anything to save
them from their iate is doubtful. He had not in hie
constitution the stuff that nmrtyrs are made of, and
the only thing he can point to at a later date aa an act
in assistance of his persecuted friends is the accam·
modation with a sum cf money and with the
sympathy cf a perscnal visit (hut outside of the city)
of the philosopher Artemidorus, against whom per·
sonally uo action was ‹lir·rmterl.² l'lirry's frieudslrip,
therefore, cest him little, though hc tries, not very
successfully, to ,malie cut iu after years that hc wras
himself then aud later iu great danger! But the
facts seem to be against his errateruiou. Hc had been
advanoed by llomitiarr's sym-iel favour: hc was disercet
enough to keep reasonahly quiet during his practor-
