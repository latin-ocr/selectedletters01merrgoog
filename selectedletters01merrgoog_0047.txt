which many others in Italy apparently owe their
origin, is in the same library as B, having been trans
fcrred thither lrom the library ol St. Mark's in the
serare city (cod. S. Marci 284). The writing is oi the

A second family ol MSS. is best represented bya
codex in Carolingian minuscules oi the ninth century,
in the same Florentiae library asB aad!¹ (Bibl.
MedieeoLeurent. plut. xtvn. No. 36). It is cited in
this edition as Μ (lllab'cees). lt has the great merit

tenth century (cod. l'at. lat. 3864). It is cited in
this edition as V (Vaticanus). Unlortunately it con
