tiens, and the someuhat full index may perhaps
render them availahle for reference at other times
than the first reading.

Ι have never thought the introductory peges of a
school edition of a classic author the best place fora
display of the hleachod and arid hones of his gram·
matieal and stylistic framcwork, laid out in classified
order before the student's repugnant vision. Such
work appears to me, like long discussione of textual
matters, to find its proper position in separate articles
or unetises. Ι trust Ι shall not unduly offend the
judicious by following my own fancy in this regenl,
and relegating my ossuary to an inconspicuous
position at the end of the book. The letters included
iu this selection show most of the peculiarities of
Pliny's grammar and style. Ι have referred in the
notes to themora striking instances as they occur,
with more or less crossreferences, and have added at
some expense to my own feelings a classified index to
these matters, which I hope will serve for the student
all practica} purposes.

Ι owe much gratitudo to my wife, and to Professor
Charles Krmpp of Columbia University, who have
very acalously and unsclfishly given me tho bencfit of ¹
their suggestions and assistance iu procl-reading us
thesc pagos haro boon going through thc press. ,
