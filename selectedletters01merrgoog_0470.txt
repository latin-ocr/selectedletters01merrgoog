x. tu in their connection), N erva’s fatal illness (he died dan.
27, 98), and the pressing duties of Pliny’s new prefectnre (of
the treasury of Satura) on which he probably entered in
August or October, 98 (see the editor’s article in Amer. Jonr.
Phil. xxm. 4). At the time of writing the present letter he
has been in steady attendance upon his work for some eon-
siderable time, and feels that he has earned a somewlrat
extended holiday. But Sept. 101 (which Mommsen adopts
aethe date) is much too far removed from the beginning of
his prefecture to be the possible date, eren if it were true (as
it apparently is not) that Pliny was at that time still prefect
of the treasnry. Moreover snch a determination conflicts
with the strict chronological order ol the letters in Beck x.
(see Introd. p. xxxviii), for x. 10 was evidently written
shortly before Trajan’s return ιο Rome, toward the eud of 99.
The mention of this furlough in connection with the csse of
Caecilius Classicus in 111. 4 introduces no difficulty, though
the argument about the chronology of that case is too lon to
be entered upon here—As Trajan was still beyond the Alps,
some weeks must bave been allowed for this letter to resch
him and for an answer to be returned before Sept. l.

Pliny goes on to speak of his new lanas being to let his landa
‘on shares' instead of for a fix rentsl, whence it may be
concluded that the latter had been his eustom up to that time,
and hence at the time when the present letter was written.
