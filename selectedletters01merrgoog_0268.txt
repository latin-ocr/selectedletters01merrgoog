a later letter Pliny mentions securin for hini a military
tribuneship which he finally asked to bave transferred to a
friend (111. 8.) Trajan granted him at Pliny's request the ius
trium liberorum (x. 94, 95), and it has been supposed by some
scholare, thou hnnnecessarily, that Suetonius was a member
of Pliny’s sta in Bithynia nt that time. In 1. 24 Pliny urges
a friend to secure for Suetonius at a good bargain a coveted
estate near the city, and in lx. 34 asks the advice of Suetonius
about haring his lector read instead of the author at a public
recitation. The volumes which he urges Suetonius in v. 10
te publislr without further delay were probably not the eight
books de Caesarum cito, which were not actually publislred
until 120 mn. Nor were they probably any of the other
works of which fragments, or mention, have come down to
ns: for all of these apparently were written in the forty years
of his life after his removal from the office of epietrdarum
mapiater under Hadrian, at the same time, and for the same
reason, that his friend Se ticius Clarus lost liis office of
praetoriam prefect (cf. intr . note to 1. l,—Sel. 1).

1. somnio: the almost universal belief in antiquity (and
to a marked degree amorpg modern natione) in the presago of
dremns is well known. any books were written yGreelrs
and Romans on their proper interpretation, of which the
most elaborate and famous was t at by Artemidorus of
Daldis at the endoi the second century mn. Others, by
Chrysippus and Antipater, are cited by Cicero in his argu-
ment against the prophetie character ol dreams in Diu. rr.

practice in accordanee with the suggestions of dreams, and
such a rationalist as the elder Pliny was not free from the
