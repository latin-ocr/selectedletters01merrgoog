Festus (so inscrr. give his lull name) had passed through the
usual grades ol office, and was lapara-s pro praetore in com-
mand of troops in the province of Africa under Piso ss
proconsul. He was related to Vitellius by marriage, and
at first tried to steer a middle course between him aad
Vespasian (Tae. Hist. ιι. 98), cing so far as to maha an
attempt (but fruitlessly) to eulist Piso ou the side ol
the Vitellians as a leader against Vcspasian. But when
Mucianus sent a centurion with orders to hill Piso,
Festus joined the wiruring side, and Piso was killed hya

him and Titus.
