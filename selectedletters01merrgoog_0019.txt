INTRODUC'I'ION.

Pliny, indeed, is the only writer of the time who
aflords ns any great help in our search, and hc within
buta limitcd field. For he was born ont of tlrc
level of thc great populace that made Rome, and he
laclred the adventurous spirit of philosophie initiative
that might have carried him away from the level of
his birth to study the lives of others. He enjoysd
life so thoroughly within the narrow range of tho
company of his peers as never to feel its limitatione.
Indead, the time of sociology as a sciense—or as
a religion-was not yet. Most men were too much
occupied in the extemral pleasures of their new-
born summer to think very gravely or stucly very
deeply.

Pliny—often called the Younger (miaor) to dis
tinguish him from his uncle, the author of the

⁷ Natural History1-was not born in Rome. He was

a native of Comum, son of a certain L. Caecilius
L. f. Oi10,² who apparently died whilc yct a young
man, after filling the office of prodactae· aedilis³ in
his municipality. Those who lilre may imagine that
he was therefore connected by blood with that
Caecilius of Comum who was a friend of the poet
Catullus, and himself a poet.⁴ Pliny was born
