ciceronis pro Murena: the defence of L. Licinius Murena,
cos. desig. in 63 ae, from the charge of errabit-ao. The speech
as preserved to ns is of quite respectable length, but in 5 57
the paragrapho de Postumi crirainibas, de Serui ‹tdrrleaceatia
are given by title only. The third part of Cicero’s earliest
:ath lltsaf'ssdtll‘h §illaad liliatl'et‘t
Vareno is not extant. But Cicero’s usual cuetom seems to
have been to publish his sreeches in snbstantially thesaure
form in which they were ‹elicered, eren though they were
rbot emundati& to writing till after delivery (cf. arar. 91;

tac. 1v. .

sumptio: the written declaration of the crimes
alleged, which the plaintifl was compelled to file belore
admission to standing before the court: cf. lliy. min. 2. 7
si cai ericam obiciatur, praecedere dehet crimen odacripfr'a

cienena, cam aciat iardtam eibi clarificarent.

8. alt, etc: cf. Cic. Olraerd. 19ss occant laborem, qai rocam

speech as to the extreme conrplexity of the case, the entire
content ol which he mastered and presented, instetal of
sharing it with other oounsel.

pro c. cornelio quadriduo emec: cf. Ascon. p. 62² Or.
Cicero ipae significat quatriduo Concedam dejeralr'rcc, quar
actiorres annulatae eam in daca orationes ammae. lt does not
follow that Cicero’s actual speeches were urrnsually long, as
mach time nrust hare been corisunred in the exarnination
of witnesses, end in the other incidente of a wrangling
trial The ease was tried in 65 ac. on a technical charge of
mairam, and apparently was of the utmost irnpnaance.
But the speeches hare coine down to ns in the rncrcsl
fragments only.

C. Corneliae. l'liny aplanently refers tn thern as a single lrooh

because they were pnlrlished together. And Cornelius Nepos .
