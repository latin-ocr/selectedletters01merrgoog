⁴40 C. PLINl EPISTVLAE SELEC'I'AE. ital. l

cansa qussi deo: Pliny doubtless was told as much
about the founder of the ananthorized association assiluit ,
his friend Tacitus lrnew (Ana. xv. 44). but does not consider
the account of auy irnportance. That Christ was now adorei
as a god would not attract the especial attention of alienun
who was actpuainted with the cultof officially deified emperors
(cf. rw. ll. li.-—Sel. :ih—n. dini), with the v ries of other
secta-or even with the Euhemeristic philosop y.

testimony to the early ase of autiphonal hymno, or charte, ιιι

lamento: perhaps only in the sense of ‘oath.’ Pliny

supposed of course that the members of so commanding an

ἶ association were as usual Ιιοιιιιιί together by some such

obligation, and ascertained from the backsliders that such

ξ was the fact—they, however, referring to general ob' tione

' and teachings of morality under their profession, and etoa

specilic oath, lilre the military oath (on which ef. x. 29. 2,-

· Sel. 86). But although true Christiane might suppren all

l 'reference to the sacred Eucharist in the presence of an un·

2 believer, these witnesses may have had no such scruple, aud

there is therefore the possibility that as early as this the

Latin-speaking Christiane were using the word ιαοναιιιιιιοιςιι

⁴ ι for the sacrament that bound them into one brotherhood in

1 l Christ, and that Pliny simply failed to comprehend the familiar
ς ⁴ term in its strange meaning.

non in scelus aliquod : for the unusual degree of clennish·
ness and secrecy of the Christiana. and their withdrawal from
participation in those popular religious festivals and social life
ulrich members of other callepio shared in freely‚ appear
to have given riso already to the belief current later that
their mystery‚ because great, was a criminal conspiracy
against society. Tacitus says (Ana. xv. 44) thatthe Christiana
were perstapitio ι’ςιιιὶιος.

ne depositum appellati abnegarent: the lack of harrlrsand
a honlring system made it necessary ou many occasions to
entrust the custody of money or other valuablca to privato
persons Temptations to embezzlement were therefore urauy.
