earlier in Trajan's reign-Pliny was continually asking lor

QQQQ

modo uelis: modo is not ‘equivalcnt to 11 niodo,’ but
nelis is a hortator subjunctive ol the second person with
definite subject (cl. 1. 10. 11,-801. 7, n. 101101, perusinus),
and is coordinated with deerant, thus taking the place of a
congleijional protasis Cf. 101 sn analogous use 1. 12. 8 (Sel. 8)
n. 11101.
