to attend him upon such occasions, 111111 that another nged
and famous man, Corellius Rufus, had always been equally

to apologiae ιο one ο1 his friends for being unable to return,
apparently from Umbria, in timeto render him this courtesy

was held at this time for 1111 entire year, dating from the first
day ο1 Januury (Mommsen Stanter. 11.⁸ ‘204; 1. 599), the dete
of this meeting with Regulus is readily fixed as Jan. 1, 97.
