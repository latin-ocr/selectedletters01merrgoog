LIBER I.

1. (L 1.)

A ossnrcr'roau epistle to Septicius, serving as an introduction
to the first book‚¹or to the first puhlislred group ol books
(see Introd. p. xl). 'Phe Septicius :uldressed is doubtless
C. Septicius titirus, to whom Suetonius, another friend oi
Pliny (see introductory note to 1. 18,—Sel. 12), is said by
dohannes Laurentius Lydus (De Moy. 11. 6) to have dedicated
his well-known Lives of the Caesare. Septicius served as
praefectus praetorio under Hadrian from 119 to 121 nra, but
was removed from office ior lack of respect to the cmpress
Sabina (S rt Hodr. 9, 11). Beyond thesc iocts nothing is
known oi irn except through the letters of Pliny, who says
ol him in 11. 9. 4 0. Septicium, quo nihil uerno, aiiii simplicius,
nihil candidius, nihil fidelius noia. The only other letters
addressed to hirn by Pliny are 1. lo (Sel. 10), vir. 28 (Sel.
55), and vui. l, a brief letter mentioning a snio arrival froin
a Journey, and the serious illness oi a favourite slave.
